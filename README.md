# scooby_stacks

This was my first "big" Verilog project. It's a 16bit stack based processor with a miniscule instruction set designed to run Euclid's algorithm. As I've gone back recently and looked through the source through the lense of experience, I see a lot of design issues and waste, so if I ever have time to revist this, there will be many changes. For now, it's a snapshot of my own growth as a developer.
